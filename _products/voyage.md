Delicately perched on the “Chalice of Life” jewelry piece, created in 1965, the butterfly decorating the bottle, symbolizing the soul and a quest for eternity, is an invitation by the Master Perfumer to an imaginary flight.
An evanescent and luminous floral bouquet, to take flight on a dreamlike journey.
