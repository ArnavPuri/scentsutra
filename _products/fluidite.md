The soft watch is a favorite of the Dalinian iconography.

Alberto Morillas makes an olfactory homage to the 1949 jewelry piece « The Persistance of memory », to illustrate the fluidity of imaginary time.

Sublime, radiant and sensual tuberose, the fragrance illustrates time in perpetual movement, slipping away just like the fragrance on the skin, in perfect harmony, until the end of time.
