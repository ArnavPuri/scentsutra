The Dali jewel “The eye of time” - 1949 – has inspired this bottle, dazzling with endless beauty. Stucked by the strength of the Dalinian eye, symbolizing discovery and desire, Perfumer Alberto Morillas interprets it to tickle both the sight and spirit. A carnal, mysterious and élégant Rose, to transform our vision of the world into permanent enchantement.
