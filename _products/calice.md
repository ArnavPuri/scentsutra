The perfumerʼs homage to the “Tristan and Isolde” jewelry piece created by Salvador Dali in 1953 to express love and eternity.
Crowned with a sacred vase, the bottle holds an intensely scented love potion to delight all the senses.
Smooth and sensual, luxuriant and contrasting, this fragrance becomes a temptation to give in to eternal seduction.
